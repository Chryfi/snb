**Skin&Bones** is a mod that allows import BOBJ (extended OBJ format) animated models that are available through Metamorph, and they can be configured in as similar fashion as [Emoticons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emoticons) morphs. 

This project is abandoned. You can continue, if you want to, but give me proper credit, and you'll have to support the userbase yourself. There is no way I'm going to support any questions regarding BOBJ format, loading models, and etc. **You're on your own**.
